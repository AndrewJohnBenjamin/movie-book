# MovieBook

Welcome to the movie book! A web interface into the public [TMDB Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US). The interface allows for searching for movies, tv shows and people and also allows being able to browse content relevant to that person/Tv show/movie. 

Future versions will include the ability to watch trailers, browse stills as well as the ability to view Tv seasons and other collections provided by the api.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

Only a basic e2e exists for this project - It is the default ootb one provided by the angular cli. This is due to the application querying a public api that is not controlled by itself. Therefore the content of the pages could change at any point. A future improvement could be to provide a stable mock api that the e2e tests can run against; but it is beyond the scope of this innitial version
